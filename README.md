# Simple Genetic algorithn

Tune the hyperparameters to see the impact
Simple genetic algorithm implementation for educational purpose
The target in this code is to find a solution to 1*U + 1*V + 1*W + 1*X + 1*Y + 1*Z = 30
The function to minimize is f = 1*U + 1*V + 1*W + 1*X + 1*Y + 1*Z - 30 see also evaluation attribute in class Individual
The fitness represent how good a chromosome/solution is and is borned to 1
The selection process is done according to roulette wheel

## Install and configure project

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

Go to genetics.py and play with hyperparameters

```bash
./genetics.py
```
